# simple-Linear-Regression-on-diabetes-dataset
This is the project on simple linear regression on inbuilt dataset in jupyter notebook i.e diabetes dataset. linear regression is nothing but finding the value of dependant variable i.e target variable on the basis of independant variable i.e feature value.
linear regression y=mx+c where m is slope and c is y-intercept which is constant
we are going to use inbuilt sklearn.datasets library to import datasets.
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression is inbuile library for finding linear regression
we are going to implement regression line and visualize by using matplotlib library.
here in diabetes datasets there are some features ['age', 'sex', 'bmi', 'bp', 's1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 's6']  and the target value.
we have to predict the target value by using features.
