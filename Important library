   import pandas as pd
2. for visualize the graph we use matplotlib library
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3. for importing inbuilt datasets sklearn is used
   from sklearn import linear_model, datasets
4. For finding linear regression we are going to use 
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
5. finding mean square error  
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
